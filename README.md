# ABSTRACT:

One of the important applications of Internet of Things is Smart agriculture. Smart agriculture reduces wastage of water, fertilizers and increases the crop yield. In the current agriculture system the specification such as temperature, moisture, humidity are detected manually which increases the labor cost, time and also monitoring cannot be done continuously. In this paper irrigation process is done automatically using different sensors which reduces the manual labor. Here a system is proposed to monitor crop-field using sensors for soil moisture, humidity and temperature. By monitoring all these parameters the irrigation can be automated.

# PROBLEM:


Farmers are under pressure to produce more food and use less energy and water in the process. A remote monitoring and control system will help farmers effectively with these pressures. Irrigated farms typically deploy a single pump to irrigate 80 to 100 acres of land.


# BASIC IDEA:

Smart farming is an emerging concept that refers to managing farms using technologies like IoT, robotics, drones and AI to increase the quantity and quality of products while optimizing the human labour required by production.

# SOLUTION IDEA:

Subscription based application for providing analysis of crops and fields.The smart farming devices designed in such a way that should be profitable compared to traditional farming methods and the device should be reusable.Easy and simple setup is required and less number of connections and sensors are used for efficient performance. Everything can be controlled from anywhere through cloud.
